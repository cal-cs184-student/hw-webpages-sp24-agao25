<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this homework, we implemented various geometric models to create meshes of 2D curves and 3D objects. This involved the manipulation of interpolation functions/algorithms, triangle meshes and the halfedge data structure, and various functions to smooth or transform the displayed model. The halfedge data structure is really interesting in how it can allow us to traverse through an entire mesh with only a few pointers, but a lot of reassignments. It's also pretty cool to compare how we can manually manipulate the mesh to try to improve the mesh versus using an algorithm to subdivide.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    de Casteljau's algorithm relies on successive, recursive linear interpolation to obtain intermediate points until a final interpolated point is calculated. To evaluate Bezier curves, we wrote a method that utilizes a for loop to perform the linear interpolation between two points for that level of recursion. Each time "E" is pressed, the algorithm runs and the interpolation reduces the number of points by 1. For example, from the initial level with four control points, we'll move to the 2nd level with 3 interpolated points now. Once we reach one final point (a Bezier point), the algorithm is done. Then, a Bezier curve can be graphed from edge point to edge point with that Bezier point on the curve as well.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    The de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces by performing the linear interpolation in multiple different directions over an array of control points. In this way, we can identify multiple Bezier curves in one direction each with a Bezier point, and then interpolate those points into a singular point on the surface. These surface points when connected will ultimately form a surface. We implemented this by first defining an evaluateStep called that can perform a single level of interpolation. Then, we defined a method called evaluate1D that given some control points, can finish the linear interpolation in one direction and return the single, final control point. Finally, we defined a method called evaluate that performs evaluate1D on an array of control points in one direction to return some Bezier curvees and then performs evaluate1D again in the perpendicular to return a singular surface point.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    We implemented area-weighted vertex normals by first calling out the initial halfedge and defining an empty Vector3D to store the weighted normal vectors. Then, we use a do/while loop to iterate through all of the faces that contain the given vertex, weight each face's normal vector components with the face's area, and sum up each of the weighted normals. The normalization of this summed vector gives us the vector to be used in Phong shading.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We implemented the edge flip operation by first accounting for the case of boundary edges, and then defining every item in the 2-triangle, half-edge data structure. And we had to pay special attention to the order because if an item was assigned too early, it may have downstream impacts on other parts of the data structure. After drawing the flip operation on a diagram by hand, we noted what items had been changed and repointed all appropriate items in our update sections. The flip operation is essentially a swap of some variables and then redefining the neighboring components.

<p>
    With task 4, our only eventful debugging was having to review all of our assignments and pointers to make sure that the pointers were pointing to the right thing and that the code was typo free. Sorting out typos fixed our code and produced the correct results.
</p>
<br>


<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    We implemeneted the edge split operation by again defining the components of the initial half-edge structure  and then defining and performing a midpoint split of the middle edge. We define new edges, half-edges, vertices, and faces to support the creation of new triangles by the split operation. This new midpoint allows us to redefine the inner edges based on the midpoint vertex and then we assign or reassign each of the triangles' components to either existing elements or newly defined ones. Once we update the halfedges based on the new components, we're done. The split operation creates two new faces, 3 new edges, one new vertex, and 6 new half edges since the split visually makes more triangles.

<b>
    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    Our debugging journey involved debugging our averaging function and debugging part 3 to make sure Phong shading works properly. When we initally finished the algorithm, the teapot was splitting but the edge that was split essentially dented into the geometry. This was really weird behavior, and then we realized that midpoint is not (point1 - point2)/2 which just causes at least component of the 3D midpoint to become 0 if the points are similar in one axis. Once we changed it to point1 + point2, the midpoint part matched the proper definition. We also had to debug part 3 because Phong shading wasn't working properly once we split and then flipped the split edge. This was because our initial code based the weighted area off of the norm's norm which when the split edge was flipped, might have been flipping the norm inwards or causing the area to be 0. To address this bug, we redid our "find area" section to be based off the three points of each triangle so that we were taking the cross product of two vectors that define the triangle. This also already weights the normal by the area, so we just need to sum the surrounding edges and normalize the sum.
